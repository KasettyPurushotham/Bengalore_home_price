# Bengalore Home Price Prediction :

### Description:
In this project, we aim to predict home prices in Bangalore using machine learning techniques. Bangalore, the capital of Karnataka in India, is a rapidly growing city with a booming real estate market. Accurate price predictions can assist potential buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in making informed decisions.

### Input:
The input to our model consists of various features that can influence home prices, including the following:

- Location: The neighborhood or area where the property is situated.
- Total Square Feet: The total area of the property in square feet.
- Number of Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the property.
- Number of Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the property.
- Amenities: Additional features like parking facilities, gym, swimming pool, etc.
- Age of the Property: The age of the property in years.
- Connectivity: Proximity to schools, hospitals, transportation, etc.


### Output:
The output of our model is a predicted price for a given set of input features. The predicted price represents the estimated value of the property based on the provided information.

### Result:
To evaluate the performance of our model, we use various evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared score. We split our dataset into training and testing sets, and after training our model on the training set, we evaluate its performance on the testing set. We aim to achieve low values for MSE and MAE and a high R-squared score, indicating accurate predictions.

### Conclusion:
By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can develop a predictive model that can effectively estimate home prices in Bangalore. The model takes into account various factors that influence property prices, such as location, size, amenities, and connectivity. With accurate price predictions, buyers and sellers can make better decisions, and real estate professionals can provide valuable insights to their clients.
